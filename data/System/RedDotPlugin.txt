---+!! %TOPIC%

This plugin renders a clickable red dot (<a style="color:red; font-weight:bold; padding-left:2px; padding-right:2px; line-height:100%; font-size:18px; text-decoration:none" href="%SCRIPTURLPATH{"edit"}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%?t=%SERVERTIME{"$year$mo$day$min$sec"}%">.</a>) to ease the edit access to
a page. The red dot will only be visible if the current wikiuser has
write access to the page the dot points to. You might also specify
a list of topics (see syntax), where the first topic that grants
write access will be the target when you click on the red dot. After finishing an edit
initiated by a red dot you will be redirected to the topic where the red dot was on, or any
other topic that you specify. Note, however, that you need to enable cookies in your browser.

%TOC%

---++ REDDOT
Syntax: =%<nop>REDDOT{"&lt;topic1>[,..., &lt;topicN>]" ... }%= 

Renders a _reddot_ for the given topic. If there are multiple topics
=topic1=, =topic2=, ...., =topicN=, then the first target topic that
grants write access will be chosen.

Arguments: 
   * =redirect="&lt;jump-back-topic>"=: 
     specifies the topic to jump back to after the edit process was completed;
     defaults to the originating topic where the red dot was on 
   * =text="..."=:
     display text for the edit link; defaults to a dot ( =.= ) 
   * =style="..."=: 
     css to be added to the reddot style
   * =class="..."=: 
     css class to be asigned to this reddot
   * =grant="..."=: 
     regular expression to be checked in addition to the implicite access check 
     for write access; reddot only if the =grant= pattern matches 
   * =icon="..."=:
     name of an icon to be used instead of the display text (see [[VarJQICON][JQICON]])

---++ Examples
   * %TOPIC%%REDDOT%  will get a red dot only if you are in the 
     %USERSWEB%.AdminGroup.
   * %WIKIUSERNAME%%REDDOT{"%WIKIUSERNAME%"}% points to your homepage.
